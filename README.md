# Grayscale Skeleton for Grav

![Grayscale](assets/grayscale.png?raw=true) 

This Grav skeleton is based around the [Grayscale Grav theme](https://github.com/vmcosta/grav-theme-grayscale) which in turn, is a port of the [Grayscale theme] by [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/).

# Features

* New! Easy to edit custom PNG map marker

## Existing Grav site

It is possible to install just the theme, but page content will need to reference the [Grayscale theme](https://github.com/vmcosta/grav-theme-grayscale)'s supported templates.  It is strongly advised to at least install the Grayscale Skeleton package to see the theme's capabilities in action.

To install  **just** the theme:

```
$ bin/gpm install grayscale
```
