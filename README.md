# Grayscale Skeleton for Grav

![Grayscale](assets/grayscale.png?raw=true) 

This Grav skeleton is based around the [Grayscale Grav theme](https://github.com/vmcosta/grav-theme-grayscale) which in turn, is a port of the [Grayscale theme] by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/).

# Features

* LESS files and compiled CSS included
* Fixed top navigation that collapses on scroll
* Smooth scrolling animations
* Scrollspy that highlights active page sections
* Custom outline button style
* Google Maps API integration with a custom Google Maps skin by Snazzy Maps
* New! Easy to edit custom PNG map marker

The simplest way to install Grayscale theme for Grav is to download and install the Agency Skeleton package:

2. Simply unzip the package into your web root folder.
3. Point your browser at the folder, job done!

**TIP:** Check out the [general Grav installation instructions](http://learn.getgrav.org/basics/installation) for more details on this process.

## Existing Grav site

It is possible to install just the theme, but page content will need to reference the [Grayscale theme](https://github.com/vmcosta/grav-theme-grayscale)'s supported templates.  It is strongly advised to at least install the Grayscale Skeleton package to see the theme's capabilities in action.

To install  **just** the theme:

```
$ bin/gpm install grayscale
```
